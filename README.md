# Windows Thread Pool Example

This repository provides a simple example demonstrating how to create and manage threads using the **Windows Thread Pool API** in C++.  

The project is intended for **educational purposes**, showing how thread pools can be set up, workers submitted, and tasks executed without manually handling thread creation and destruction.  

### Features
- Uses the **Windows Thread Pool API** (`CreateThreadpool`, `CreateThreadpoolWork`, etc.)
- Demonstrates creating a reusable worker function
- Shows callback-based thread execution
- Written in clean, minimal C++ for easy learning

### Notes
- This example is **not production-ready** â€” proper error handling and resource management should be added in real applications.
- Works only on **Windows platforms**.
- Licensed under the **MIT License**.
